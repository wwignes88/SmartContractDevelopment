The VRF_Mock_with_Oracle project has a readme pdf file which should be consulted for those who are new to eth-brownie. This project makes use of 'EventWatcher' which listens for emitted events. 

!!!!! something I failed to mention in the aforementioned readme pdf file is that EventWatcher works on alchemy buy you may have problems using it with infura. This I believe relates to https vs. wss (websocket) node provider addresses. Alchemy supports testing on sepolia for free, but it will require an upgraded membership to test on the polygon-mumbai network. The second project 'AAVETrades' attempts to make use of EventWatcher to listen for emitted events during a flashLoan, but I ran into problems here and opted not to troubleshoot for the time-being. See notes in AAVETrades/scripts/FlashLoan/flashLoan.py file for a detailed explanation.
