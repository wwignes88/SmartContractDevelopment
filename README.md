The VRF_Mock_with_Oracle project has a readme pdf file which should be consulted for those who are new to eth-brownie. This project makes use of 'EventWatcher' which listens for emitted events. 

* I am close to finishing an NFT repo which will make use of the VRFCoordinatorV2.sol contract to perform LIVE requests for random words. The event watcher deployed here will filter requests for randomness by requestId.

!!!!! something I failed to mention in the aforementioned readme pdf file is that EventWatcher works on alchemy buy you may have problems using it with infura. This I believe relates to https vs. wss (websocket) node provider addresses. Alchemy supports testing on sepolia for free, but it will require an upgraded membership to test on the polygon-mumbai network. The second project 'AAVETrades' attempts to make use of EventWatcher to listen for emitted events during a flashLoan, but I ran into problems here and opted not to troubleshoot for the time-being. See notes in AAVETrades/scripts/FlashLoan/flashLoan.py file for a detailed explanation.
